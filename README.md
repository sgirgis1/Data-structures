Data Structures Open Dataset Project
-------------------------------------
Worked at the Abstract Data Type logicial level to develop a Java program 
which uses an array list to maintain the QSR Top 50 Fast Food in 2019 dataset.
The application allows a user to display a subset of data via a simple interface.
A user can enter a fast food category, rank number, name of the restaurant, or all.
Corresponding information in relation to the user input will appear including restaurant name(s), average sales, rank(s), and category. If user input is "quit" the application will terminate.
